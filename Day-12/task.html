    <h1>Block</h1>
    <div class="block"> A div block (div) is a block-level HTML element used to group other HTML elements together.It does not have any visual meaning by default, but it helps in structuring a webpage. A (div) always starts on a new line and takes the full width available. Developers commonly use (div) to apply CSS styles, manage layout, and organize content like headers, sections, images, and text. It is very useful when building page layouts such as containers, columns, and sections. The (div) tag makes web design more flexible and organized.</div>

    <h2>Inline</h2>
    <span class="inline">An inline element is an HTML element that does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as needed. Inline elements appear within a line of text and flow naturally with surrounding content. Common inline elements include span, a, strong, and em. They are mainly used for styling small parts of content, such as highlighting a word, adding a link, or emphasizing text. Inline elements cannot contain block-level elements and usually do not accept width and height properties. They are useful for formatting text without breaking the layout.</span>

    <h3>Inline-block</h3>
    <p class="inline-block">An inline-block element is a combination of inline and block behaviors in HTML. It stays on the same line like an inline element, but it also allows block-level properties such as width, height, margin, and padding. Unlike inline elements, inline-block elements can be sized and styled more freely. Common uses include creating buttons, navigation menus, and image galleries. Elements like img and elements styled with display: inline-block can align horizontally while still maintaining a structured layout. Inline-block is useful when you want elements side by side with full styling control.</p>
