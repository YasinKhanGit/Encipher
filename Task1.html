    <center><h3 style="font-style: oblique;">Why do I want to learn HTML?</h3>
    <p align="justify">I want to learn HTML because it is the foundation of every website. By learning HTML, I can create my own web pages and understand how websites work. It is easy to learn and very useful for anyone interested in web development. HTML also helps me build a strong base before learning CSS, JavaScript, and full-stack development. It improves my technical skills and opens more opportunities in the IT field. Knowing HTML gives me confidence to design simple pages, create projects, and start my journey in web development.</p>
